title: Final Showcase
---
#### Summary "Final Exam Day"
* It will not be a final Exam
* We will have a `Robotics Fair` where each student team will showcase their work
* I will invite interested computer science and other students to come visit
* We will have food and drink

#### Your goal
* Show case what you've learned and what you built in the best possible light
* Be prepared with powerpoints or a poster to explain it as well as you can
* Come up with a cool and interesting demo
* Make sure that you reserve the robot you need for your demo
* If you want to share a demo with another team that's fine
* But the assessment will be individual
