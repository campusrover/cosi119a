* **Final deliverables are due at 11:59** of the last day of class, TODAY!
    * I realize that the presentation slides might need to change as you practice, so they may be resubmitted if you want to. The deadline for resubmission is midnight the day before presentation day.
    * Remember your <%= link_to_topic :cosi165a_final_deliverables %>!
* How is the preparation going for the final showcase?
* **Feedback on how to make the course better**: Open discussion of feedback on how to make the course better
* **Practice**: Who wants to present their current presentation to the class for feedback?
