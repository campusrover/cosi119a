<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. Be prepared by doing all the pre-work: <%= link_to_topic :cosi119a_prework %>

#### Welcome!

##### Introduction
* Who are you and what area of computer science are you currently excited by?
* If nothing else, what do you want out of this course
* Robotics is fun!
* Computer Science meets Software Engineering meets Math
* You don't have to be an expert in all (or any)
* Very few Cosi courses involve hardware!
* History of this course
* How is it different this semester?
* Demo Of a Real Robot from last semester!

##### Overall Big Picture Goal
* Our grand vision: <%= link_to_topic :campus_rover %>
* Why it's interesting and why it's hard
* Discuss Mark1 and begin thinking about Mark2
* Why I am excited about this course

##### Overall Course Structure
* Two lectures + 1 Lab
* Lots of out-of-classroom work

##### Final Projects
* The last 4 weeks
* 1-4 students
* Goal and deliverables agreed upon before then
* Counts for major part of the grade
* Possible projects (more detail coming)
    * Gesture recognition
    * Planning algorithms
    * Facial recognition
    * ML to improve wall following
    * Balance a stick on the back of a turtle

* Process
    1. Investigate something relevant to Campus Rover, which was not covered in class
    1. Find relevant literature
    1. Identify previous work, libraries, examples to learn from
    1. Create a working demo and presentation and paper

##### Our Lab
* Take a look at Lab set up 
* Our Robot platforms
* How to use the 3 hour block
* Take a look together at the web site
* Take a look at github together
* Discuss <%= link_to_topic :lab_rules %>

#### Next Class

* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
