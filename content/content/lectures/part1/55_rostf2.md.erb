* Homework TBD

#### TF
* TF package in ROS is central
* It recently was rewritten and shows up as TF2 in many places
* It is interesting and important to understand in some more detail

##### Review
* Pose = position and orientation
* Pose is always with respect of a specific coordinate frame or TF
* Usually a coordinate begins as the "natural" way to think about It
  * Angle of obstacle, with respect to the LIDAR
  * Position a corner, with respect to the whole room
  * Angle to turn, from the point of view of the robot itself
  * So when you see phrases like "with respect to", and "from the point of view of" you know these refer to coordinate frames.
* It is very common to want to see that same point or angle from another's point of view
  * How bit a turn to I need to point directly away from the wall?
  * What direction is the nearest door from me?
* Compare starboard/port and driver vs. passenger side

##### Lets look at some code
* Review the series of [ROS TF2 Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials) Together

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
