1. <%= partbadge %> **Reading**:  PRR - Chapters 1,2 (Follow along - <%= link_to_topic :ros_intro %>, <%= link_to_topic :ros_fundamentals %>)
1. <%= zipbadge %> **Programming Environment**: Demonstrate booting to the SSD. Make a short narrated video with your phone showing your computer booting up into Linux and you running roscore from the shell. If roscore runs you likely have a good install. <%= deliverable "Your short video" %>

#### Review
* Autonomous robot behaviors are mechanisms constructed from carefully designed algorithms and representations.
* What's an operating system?
* Robot behavior is inherently concurrent and the code therefore his highly concurrent
* Requires the use of some kind of distributed operating system
* Distributed nature of behavior
* ROS nodes, topics and messages

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
