#### Review
* Autonomous robot behaviors are mechanisms constructed from carefully designed algorithms and representations.
* What's an operating system?
* Robot behavior is inherrently concurrent and the code therefore his highly concurrent
* Requires the use of some kind of distributed operating system
* Distributed nature of behavior
* ROS nodes, topics and messages

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
