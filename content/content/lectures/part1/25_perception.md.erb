#### How do Robots Perceive?

* Sensors are essential
   * What is a sensor?
   * Is it an input or output device?
   * What happens to the sensing information
   * How is it stored and detected and acted upon?

* Example: Lidar
   * What is a Lidar
   * What does it look like and how does it work?
   * "Time of travel" detector
   * What does the data look like?

* Show code example of Lidar data
* Subtleties:
   * What do the directions mean?
   * Are the directions absolute or relative?
   * What if the robot is not pointing to where you think?
   * Do they go clockwise or counterclockwise?
   * Lets look at the data!
   * It's not clean! (This is typical for all sensors)
   * It is not accurate!
   * It's sometimes wildly inaccurate
   * It is constantly flooding in

* Types of Sensors
   * Is a sensor an input or output device?
   * Is a keyboard a sensor?
   * Is a joystick a sensor?
   * Is a map a sensor?
   * Active Vs. Passive
   * Sensor Fusion

* Lidar

   * Key characteristics or features
   * What data it provides

* Motor (encoder)
   * How it works
   * Key characteristics or features
   * What data it provides

* Camera
   * How it works
   * Key Characteristics or features
   * What Data it provides

   * Key Characteristics or features
   * What data it provides

* Bump sensors
   * How it works
   * Key Characteristics or features
   * What data it provides

* Magnetometer, barometer, accelerometer
   * How it works
   * Key Characteristics or features
   * What data it provides

* GPS
