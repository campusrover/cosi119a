<%= include_topic :orient %>

#### Content:
* Coordinate systems
  * Where is a robot? How do we designate the location?
  * If it's a surface moving mobile robot, then an x,y coordinate would seem to be sufficient
  * We need to determine the units: for us, usually Meters
  * We need to designate the origin
  * Anything else?

* What about the "real world"?
  * Where is that 0,0?
  * Does it matter?

* What part of the robot are we talking about?
  * The "middle"?
  * Who says where the middle is?
  * Does it matter how high of the ground it is?

* What about where it is pointing?
  * Is that part of the orientation?
  * What does it mean to tell the robot to rotate right or left?
  * Is that direction also part of the orientation in space?
  * When would that matter?

* What other aspects of orientation in space?
  * If the Robot has a camera mounted on it?
  * If there is an arm?
  * Robot pushing an elevator button

* Taking action based on orientation. Think about:
  * Turn Right
  * Turn North
  * Point camera in the direction of the sound

* "Pose"
  * The combination of the robot's position and orientation (direction it is pointing)
  * Each one has 3 dimensions: x,y,z and r,p,y
  * x,y,z are cartesian coordinates
  * r,p,y are Euler coordinates

* Multiple Coordinate systems
  * Each component of the robot potentially has a coordinate system
  * Many of them have a fixed relationship to each other
  * Point 0,0 for the robot's tf might be Point 10,0 for the camera's tf
  * There are coordinate systems attached to (each) robot
  * But also to the rest of the "world" the robot knows about

* Converting between coordinate systems
  * Very common calculation is to convert a certain actual point
  * From one coordinate system to another
