1. **Programming: Maze** Please do <%= link_to_topic :hw_ros_maze %>. Note that this is a pair assignment, which means that you should work together with someone and have a single deliverable. It's important that you actually really collaborate. And that both people get a good understanding of how things work. Getting comfortable with your teammates and sorting out how to divide up the work will continue to be important.
