#### Discussion

* Think: Given these sensors how would you detect that you are about the crash into a wall?
* Think: How would you compute the angle at which you are approaching the wall?

#### How it works in ROS
* All your code (almost) in ROS is a node
* All information (almost) is transferred in the form of messages
* Sensors
  * Are electronic devices
  * Wired to the built in computer
  * In the case of the TB3, wired to the Arduino
  * Code on the Arduino read the i/o and participate as a node in ROS
  * Publishing information
* ROS info required
  * What is the "topic" that the device publishes to
  * How frequently does it publish (e.g. 10 times per second, once every second)
  * And what is the message type
* Acting on the sensor data
  * A node subscribes to that topic
  * Writes a "handler" which is invoked each time the sensor node publishes

#### Example: Lidar
