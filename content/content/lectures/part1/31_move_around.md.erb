#### Steering Wheeled vehicles

##### Our goal
* Software needs to be able to command the robot
* Consider micro and macro
  * Steer from Waltham to Boston
  * Steer from Shapiro to Usdan
  * Stay in a lane
  * Drive in a straight road
  * Turn a corner
  * Make a 90 degree turn
  * Simply drive in a straight line
* At the micro level:
  * Move at x Meters/second
  * Turn at 10 degrees/second
  
##### Steering for wheeled vehicles
* Motors drive Wheels
  * Differential Drive
  * Tri-cycle vehicle
  * Ackermann Steering
  * Articulated Vehicle

* "Differential drive"
  * Steering is achieved by driving wheels at different speeds
  * Geometry calculations to determine what delta rpm leads to what kind of turn
  * Usually three wheels, two with motors, one "caster"
* Tri-cycle steering
  * Two fixed Wheels
  * A third wheel with a steerable mount
* Ackerman Steering
  * Where the steering is achieved by actual rotation of the wheel mount
* Articulated Vehicle
  * Where the vehicle itself has a pivot point
* Notice that to steer the vehicle an algorithm needs to convert the desired rotation to proportional wheel spinning (we won't get into the geometry calculations.)

##### Other scenarios
* Tracked vehicles (tanks)
* Water surface vehicles
* Under water vehicles
* Aerial vehicles

#### Terrain
* Indoor vs. outdoor
  * Traction and slippage
  * Weather effects - wet, dry, light, dark
* Inclines and declines
  * Needs more force
  * Also affects levelness
  * Direction that cameras and sensors are pointed 

##### Work in groups
* How would you get your robot to drive in a perfect 1 meter square?
