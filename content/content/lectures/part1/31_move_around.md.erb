1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Read and Code** Read Chapters 7, 8, 9.** PLEASE remember to refer to these (<%= link_to_topic :wander_bot %>, <%= link_to_topic :teleop_bot %> and <%= link_to_topic :building_maps %>) in parallel and use the code I provided! Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it?
1. **Red/Green/Yellow**: <%= link_to_topic :hw_green_yellow_red %>. 

#### Steering Wheeled vehicles

##### Our goal
* Focusing for now on autonomous, ground based mobile robots. But principles apply
* Software needs to be able to command the robot
* Consider micro and macro
  * Steer from Waltham to Boston
  * Steer from Shapiro to Usdan
  * Stay in a lane
  * Drive in a straight road
  * Turn a corner
  * Make a 90 degree turn
  * Simply drive in a straight line
<%= discussion_box "Lets take each of these in turn. "%>
* At the micro level:
  * Move at x Meters/second
  * Turn at 10 degrees/second
 <%= discussion_box "Lets take each of these in turn. "%>
 
##### Steering for wheeled vehicles
* Motors drive Wheels
  * Differential Drive
  * Tri-cycle vehicle
  * Ackermann Steering
  * Articulated Vehicle

* "Differential drive"
  * Steering is achieved by driving wheels at different speeds
  * Geometry calculations to determine what delta rpm leads to what kind of turn
  * Usually three wheels, two with motors, one "caster"
* Tri-cycle steering
  * Two fixed Wheels
  * A third wheel with a steerable mount
* Ackerman Steering
  * Where the steering is achieved by actual rotation of the wheel mount
* Articulated Vehicle
  * Where the vehicle itself has a pivot point
* Notice that to steer the vehicle an algorithm needs to convert the desired rotation to proportional wheel spinning (we won't get into the geometry calculations.)

##### Other scenarios
* Tracked vehicles (tanks)
* Water surface vehicles
* Under water vehicles
* Aerial vehicles

#### Terrain
* Indoor vs. outdoor
  * Traction and slippage
  * Weather effects - wet, dry, light, dark
* Inclines and declines
  * Needs more force
  * Also affects levelness
  * Direction that cameras and sensors are pointed 

#### Sensors
* The role of sensors in controlling motion
* Self-sensors (like odometry)
* External sensors (like LIDAR)
* Review of dead reconning
* Review of "real robots don't drive straight"

##### Work in groups
* How would you get your robot to drive in a perfect 1 meter square?
